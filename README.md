# Two-tier-application-Deployment-AWS-Cloud-
This project deploys a two-tier Flask and MySQL app to handle 10,000 concurrent users. It uses Docker for containerization, Kubernetes with `kubeadm`, and AWS EKS for scalability and fault tolerance. Automated setup with `eksctl` and Helm ensures a multi-node cluster with a load balancer, reducing downtime by 60%.
